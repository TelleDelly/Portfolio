        I am a full stack software engineer looking for work! I specialize in
        the MERN stack and love it. I am young, hungry and ready to learn. I
        pick up things fast and love growing with the process. I enjoy all
        things full stack however I love the backend just a tad bit more. I am
        ready to fill whatever role is needed in your team so feel free to reach
        out.
